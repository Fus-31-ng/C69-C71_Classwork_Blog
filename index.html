    <p class="text-muted">The Apollo Cabins at CaSoBē offer a one-of-a-kind stay with their sleek, futuristic space capsule-inspired design. They're clean, air-conditioned, and comfortably fit up to 4 people, with a king bed, sofa bed, private bathroom, and a cozy veranda. The interiors are modern, and everything is well-maintained.

Perfect for a relaxing beach getaway or a stylish weekend escape, the Apollo Cabins combine comfort, creativity, and convenience—all just a few steps from the beach.</p>

    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Oman (more specifically Salalah and Muscat); Above image is (younger) me in Salalah</kbd></h4>

    <hr>

    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited in August to November 2016</h5>

    <p class="text-muted">Salalah is a hidden gem in southern Oman that really surprises you. It's especially stunning during the Khareef season (June to September) when the desert transforms into lush greenery and misty hills—something you'd never expect in the Middle East. The cool weather, green mountains, waterfalls like Wadi Darbat, and frankincense-scented air give it a peaceful, almost magical feel. The beaches are clean and quiet, and you can even spot camels walking along the shore!

Salalah is more laid-back than Muscat, offering a slower pace and a strong connection to nature and Omani tradition. People are warm and welcoming, and the food (especially the grilled meats and coconut drinks) is delicious and affordable.

Muscat, on the other hand, is the capital and gives you a more polished, city experience. It has beautiful Islamic architecture, especially at the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, and a scenic coastline lined with forts and souqs. It’s cleaner and more modern, but also more fast-paced and urban.

Overall, Salalah is perfect for nature lovers and cultural explorers, while Muscat offers a more cosmopolitan side of Oman. Both are worth visiting, but Salalah feels like a refreshing escape. Also there's a lot of sand in both places</p>

    <hr>

    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i want to visit sometime</h5>

    <p class="text-muted">Boracay  Island is an amazing island with powdery white sand and crystal-clear water — perfect for swimming and relaxing. White Beach is the main spot, and it’s full of restaurants, bars, and fun activities like island hopping and paddleboarding. At night, it gets lively with music and fire shows. It’s a great mix of chill and adventure, all in one beautiful place.</p>

    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Pico de Loro Beach and Country Club</kbd></h4>

    <hr>

    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited in June or July 2022</h5>

    <p class="text-muted">Pico de Loro is a peaceful beach and mountain escape tucked away in Nasugbu, Batangas, just a few hours from Manila. It’s a private, exclusive resort that’s both relaxing and scenic—surrounded by forested mountains, a lagoon, and a clean stretch of beach. The resort is named after the mountain, Pico, de Loro, which means Parrot's Beak.

The beach itself is quiet and well-maintained, great for swimming or just lounging around. The water is usually calm, and there are plenty of lounge chairs and shaded areas. There’s also an infinity pool at the Country Club, along with facilities like a gym, bowling, and indoor sports courts.

The rooms (especially those in the nearby Pico Sands Hotel or rented condos) are comfy and modern, with great views of the lagoon or mountains. Food options are good but can be a bit pricey since it’s inside a private estate. Service is generally warm and professional.

It’s a great place for family trips, group vacations with friends, or even solo retreats if you just want peace and nature without going too far.</p>

        <p>Jurassic World brings the awe and thrill of dinosaurs back to the big screen with modern effects and a fresh storyline. Set years after the original Jurassic Park, the new park is now a fully operational luxury resort – until a genetically engineered dinosaur, the Indominus rex, escapes and causes chaos.

The visuals are stunning, especially the dinosaur designs and action sequences. Chris Pratt brings charm and intensity as Owen, the raptor trainer, while Bryce Dallas Howard portrays Claire, a corporate operations manager who evolves throughout the film. The movie balances nostalgia, suspense, and action well, though some found the plot predictable or overly reliant on CGI.

Overall, Jurassic World is an exciting adventure film that successfully revives the franchise for a new generation, even if it doesn’t quite match the original’s magic. I watched this movie many times.<p>

        <p>Iron Man kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a bang. Robert Downey Jr. shines as Tony Stark, a genius billionaire who builds a high-tech suit to escape captivity and becomes a self-made superhero.

The movie blends sharp humor, slick tech, and character development, showing Tony’s transformation from a careless weapons dealer to a hero with purpose. The action is grounded yet exciting, and the tech designs, especially the Iron Man suits, are a major highlight. Jeff Bridges plays a solid villain, and the film sets the tone for what would become the biggest movie franchise in the world.

It’s a smart, stylish, and rewatchable superhero origin story that raised the bar for comic book movies. My favorite Avengers hero is Iron Man, because his suit is mostly red.</p>
